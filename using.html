						<p class = "indent">
							The second episode of The Age of AI, an eight-part series. focuses on three AI applications that have the potential to transform society as we know it. From prosthetic limbs that function organically and comprehend the user's purpose to life-saving eyesight augmentation and machine learning, this documentary investigates the limits of what human bodies are capable of.

						We must stop viewing artificial intelligence (AI) as something mysterious and otherworldly. With regard to every aspect of what it means to be a person, the only difference now is that we are pushing the limits of what scientists once believed to be conceivable. After all, since the development of the earliest primitive instruments, human enhancement and augmentation have existed. The nearly endless computational power at our disposal today has the potential to advance humanity.
