							Because of the miracles of artificial intelligence, the human body is not perfect. Research experts are figuring out how to fix those flaws. A.I. has the capacity to improve, enhance, and compensate for the deficiencies in our bodies.

						Individual heterogeneity was particularly challenging since it rendered trend detection by machine learning techniques unfeasible. Deep learning, an area of AI, eventually developed the sensitivity to distinguish speech from voice data, though. Deep learning algorithms may eventually learn to recognize words regardless of accents and other variations in speech patterns, despite the fact that they needed a lot of training data. Many businesses, notably the San Francisco-based startup Enlitic, are using deep learning in the medical sector to find abnormal tumors.
