						<h1>Saving the world one algorithm at a time: The Age of AI</h1>
						<p class = "indent">
							Many claim that humans are to blame for the planet's destruction. These individuals are working to employ artificial intelligence to save it as a result. With the aid of technology, famine, wildlife extinction, and war might one day all be avoided.

						</p>

						I can see from the video that artificial intelligence has advanced significantly. The wildlife is being impacted by the cameras and sensors they have used. The AI they deployed can tell people from animals, saving them a ton of time from having to look over every photo the camera has taken. Elephant mass extinction and the extinction of other endangered species could be prevented by readily capturing poachers. The use of AI in the food industry has had a significant impact over time because it can benefit the environment. Artificial intelligence can significantly speed up the recovery of our oceans and seabeds. Overfishing and dynamite fishing have both negatively impacted corals.

						In my opinion, artificial intelligence (AI) can benefit us in a variety of ways, not just for amusement but also for the environment.
