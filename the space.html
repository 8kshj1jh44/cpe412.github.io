							NASA has launched five rovers—robotic vehicles—to Mars over the years. Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance are the names of the five rovers. A intriguing planet is Mars. It's really cold and covered in rust-colored filth and dust. It has flat plains, gorges, and volcanoes like Earth. Researchers have also discovered canals that appear to have been carved out by rivers and streams a very long time ago.

						According to a movie I recently viewed, they were building a habitat or dome-like structure to assist astronauts survive and thrive on Mars, where the air is primarily carbon dioxide and is extremely hazardous. AIs have aided them by doing many iterations, leading to the discovery of a highly optimized concept—an egg shape—that works significantly better for a variety of reasons. Surprisingly, the Netherlands is the second-largest exporter of fresh food while scientists there are already developing artificial agriculture.
